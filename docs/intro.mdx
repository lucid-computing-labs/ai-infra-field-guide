# AI Infrastructure Field Guide

**A practitioner's guide for people who need to understand modern AI clusters — not just read about them.**

## Who This Is For

You're a verification researcher, governance professional, policy analyst, or technically curious person who needs to deeply understand how modern AI training infrastructure actually works. You've read the press releases about 100,000-GPU clusters and the policy papers about compute governance. But you haven't found a single resource that bridges the gap between vendor marketing and the ground truth of what's inside these facilities.

This field guide is that resource.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers four interconnected layers of AI infrastructure:

1. **Physical Architecture** — Racks, cooling, power delivery. Why a single GB200 NVL72 rack draws 132 kW and what that means for facility design, cooling infrastructure, and the physical constraints that shape everything above.

2. **Interconnects** — NVLink, InfiniBand, Ethernet, and the critical boundaries between them. This is where most people's mental models break down, and where the verification story gets interesting.

3. **Cluster Management** — Schedulers, orchestration, health monitoring. The software layer that turns thousands of individual GPUs into a single coherent training system.

4. **Verification Relevance** — What can you actually observe from outside? What's invisible? What does this mean for AI governance, compute monitoring, and safety verification?

## How to Use This Guide

**This is not a document to skim.** If you read it passively, you'll think you understand it, and you'll be wrong. Research on learning (particularly Andy Matuschak's work on transformative tools for thought) shows that passive reading produces an illusion of understanding that collapses when you try to apply the knowledge.

To counter this, the guide uses three active engagement techniques:

### Concept Checks

Every few hundred words, you'll hit an inline question that tests whether you actually understood the implication of what you just read — not just the definition. These are uncomfortable. That's the point. If you get one wrong, re-read the preceding section before moving on.

### Interactive Explorables

Some things can't be understood from static text. When you need to develop intuition for how parameters interact — how power scales with density, how topology affects latency, where monitoring boundaries fall — you'll find interactive components you can manipulate directly.

### "What Would You Do?" Scenarios

Each chapter ends with an open-ended scenario that connects infrastructure knowledge to a real verification or governance problem. There's no single right answer. The goal is to force you to synthesize across sections and think like a practitioner.

## How This Was Made

This guide is a collaboration between human domain experts and AI writing/engineering assistants. The prose was drafted with AI assistance and then edited by people who have actually been inside these facilities. Every section includes details that could only come from practitioners — and we've worked to remove anything that reads like a vendor whitepaper summary.

The interactive components, site infrastructure, and concept checks were built with AI coding tools. The editorial judgment, technical verification, and "smell test" for authenticity are human.

We think this hybrid approach produces better results than either pure human writing (too slow, too inconsistent) or pure AI generation (too generic, too confident about things it doesn't actually know). Your mileage may vary — and we'd love your feedback.

## Contributing

This is an open-source project. If you find errors, want to suggest improvements, or have firsthand experience that would make a section more concrete, please contribute. See our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/lucid-computing-labs/ai-infra-field-guide/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

We have a strong anti-slop policy: contributions must add real information, not pad word count. If you're adding a detail, it should be something a reader couldn't get from a quick Google search.
