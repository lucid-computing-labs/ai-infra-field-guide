# Lab Access Program

**Free access to a private cage in a production colocation data center — for verification researchers who want to move from theory to practice.**

:::info Applications Open
This is a 3-month pilot program. Access is free for qualified verification researchers. Scroll down for eligibility and how to apply.

## The Offer

Lucid Computing Labs is opening a private cage within the **Equinix SV4 colocation data center** in Sunnyvale, California to verification researchers. For a 3-month trial period, qualified researchers can:

- **Install monitoring and verification systems** on real data center infrastructure to run proof-of-concept experiments
- **Visit a production data center** — many researchers working on compute governance have never set foot inside one
- **Test verification techniques** against real hardware, real power delivery, real cooling, and real network infrastructure

There is no cost to participating researchers for the duration of the trial.

## Why This Exists

A recurring theme in AI governance and verification research is the gap between theory and practice. Papers propose monitoring architectures, attestation protocols, and verification schemes — but most researchers have never had the opportunity to test these ideas against real infrastructure.

Reading about a data center is not the same as standing in one. The noise, the scale, the physical reality of cable management and power distribution — these things change how you think about what's practical. We believe verification research will be stronger if researchers have access to real environments.

## What It Is (and What It Isn't)

This is important to understand upfront:

### What you get

- **A private cage** in a Tier III+ colocation facility. This is a physically secured enclosure within the Equinix SV4 data center, with controlled access, power delivery, and network connectivity.
- **Rack space and power** for installing your own equipment or verification instrumentation.
- **Standard data center infrastructure** — power distribution (redundant utility feeds, UPS, PDUs), cooling (facility-managed), physical security (mantrap entry, biometric access, 24/7 security), and network cross-connects.
- **Hands-on experience** with the physical environment that AI clusters actually live in: the power chain, the cooling systems, the cabling, the security model.

### What you don't get

**This is not an AI cluster.** There are no GPUs, no NVLink, no InfiniBand fabric, no training jobs to observe. It's critical to be clear about this distinction:

| | Equinix SV4 Cage | AI Training Cluster |
|---|---|---|
| **Facility type** | Colocation data center | Purpose-built AI facility |
| **Cooling** | Facility air cooling (standard colo) | Direct liquid cooling (DLC) required for modern AI racks |
| **Power density** | 5-15 kW per rack (standard) | 40-132 kW per rack (AI workloads) |
| **Compute hardware** | Whatever you bring | Thousands of GPUs (B200, H100, etc.) |
| **Network** | Standard internet/cross-connect | InfiniBand fat-tree fabric |
| **NVLink domains** | Not present | The defining feature of modern AI racks |
| **Rack-level power** | Metered at PDU level | Metered + BMC telemetry per GPU |

### What this means for your research

If you're working on verification techniques, the cage is useful for:

- **Facility-level verification:** Testing power monitoring, physical access audit systems, environmental sensing. The power delivery chain (utility → UPS → PDU → rack) is the same architecture as an AI facility, just at lower density.
- **Network monitoring instrumentation:** Installing and testing SmartNICs, TAPs, or other network monitoring equipment on real infrastructure with real latency and real cabling constraints.
- **Physical security protocols:** Developing and testing physical inspection procedures, tamper-evident seals, hardware inventory verification.
- **Sensor deployment:** Testing environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, vibration, acoustic) in a real data center environment with real background noise and thermal conditions.
- **Understanding the environment:** Experiencing the physical constraints that any verification system will need to operate within — noise, access procedures, maintenance windows, shared facility coordination.

It is **not** the right environment for:
- Testing NVLink monitoring approaches (there is no NVLink)
- Observing real training workload signatures (there are no training jobs)
- Testing GPU telemetry integrity (there are no GPUs, unless you bring your own)
- Measuring AI-scale power density effects (power density is 10-20x lower than an AI rack)

Think of it as a realistic testbed for the **facility and physical layers** of verification — the bottom of the stack described in [Chapter 01](/docs/physical-architecture). For the compute and network layers described in [Chapters 02-04](/docs/interconnects), you would need access to an actual AI cluster.

## About Equinix SV4

Equinix SV4 is a production colocation facility in Sunnyvale, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Key specs:

- **Carrier-neutral** facility with access to major cloud on-ramps and peering exchanges
- **Tier III+** design with redundant power and cooling (2N power, N+1 cooling)
- **Physical security:** 24/7 staffed, biometric + badge access, mantrap entry, CCTV throughout
- **Compliance:** SOC 1, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS

This is a facility where real production workloads run. The security model, the operational procedures, and the physical environment are representative of the kind of facility that houses AI clusters — even though the specific hardware inside is different.

## Who Should Apply

This program is designed for:

- **Verification researchers** working on compute governance, AI safety verification, or hardware-rooted trust who need a physical testbed
- **Policy researchers** who write about data center monitoring and want firsthand experience with what these facilities actually look like
- **Graduate students** working on theses related to AI compute verification, infrastructure monitoring, or data center security
- **Independent researchers** with a clear research agenda related to AI infrastructure verification

We're looking for people who have a specific idea of what they want to test or learn. "I want to see a data center" is fine as a secondary goal, but we want the cage to be useful, not just a tourist attraction.

## How to Apply

To express interest in the Lab Access Program:

1. **Open a GitHub issue** on the [ai-infra-field-guide repository](https://github.com/lucid-computing-labs/ai-infra-field-guide/issues) with the title "Lab Access: [Your Name / Organization]"
2. Describe your research focus and what you'd want to do with cage access
3. Include your timeline and any equipment you'd plan to install

We'll respond within one week. Access will be coordinated through Equinix's standard visitor and cage access procedures.

## FAQ

**How long is the trial?**
3 months from the date your access is provisioned. We may extend the program based on demand and outcomes.

**Is there really no cost?**
No cost for researchers during the trial period. Lucid Computing Labs covers the cage lease, power, and cross-connect fees.

**Can I install my own equipment?**
Yes, within the constraints of the cage (available rack units, power budget, and Equinix's acceptable use policies). We'll discuss specifics during onboarding.

**Can I visit without installing equipment?**
Yes. If you're a verification or policy researcher who simply wants to experience a data center environment firsthand, we welcome guided visits. Seeing the physical reality of these facilities is valuable.

**Where is it?**
Equinix SV4, Sunnyvale, California. Close to the Caltrain corridor and major Silicon Valley campuses.

**Do I need to be in the Bay Area?**
Not necessarily, but you need to be able to travel to Sunnyvale for physical access. Remote-only participation isn't possible — the whole point is hands-on access to physical infrastructure.
