## The Offer

Lucid Labs, the research arm of Lucid Computing, is opening a private cage within the **Equinix SV4 colocation data center** in Sunnyvale, California to verification researchers. This is a trial program — we're committing to at least 6 months, with continuation depending on uptake and resourcing. Starting **March 1, 2026**, qualified researchers can:

- **Install monitoring and verification systems** on real data center infrastructure to run proof-of-concept experiments
- **Visit a production data center** — many researchers working on compute governance have never set foot inside one
- **Test verification techniques** against real hardware, real power delivery, real cooling, and real network infrastructure

### What's There Now

The cage currently contains:

- **One cabinet** — a standard 42U rack with available space for your equipment
- **Overhead fiber tray** — with connectivity to the facility's meet-me room
- **Cross-connect to our research rack** — the cage connects via fiber to Lucid's existing research infrastructure in a separate cage, providing network connectivity through a standard firewall and a server for remote access
- **Room to grow** — the cage has space for up to 5 additional cabinets as the program expands

**Possible GPU hardware (TBD):** We're working to include at least one NVIDIA GPU in the cage, and potentially a DGX system. This is not confirmed yet — it depends on timing, availability, and logistics. If this matters for your research, mention it in your application and we'll update you on what's available. Don't plan around GPU access until we confirm it.

This is a starting point. As the program develops and researchers install equipment, the environment will evolve.

### The Deal

**Access is free.** In exchange, we ask one thing: you must commit to publishing something about your work. This could be a paper, a blog post, a technical report, or a contribution to this field guide — but it needs to be public. The goal is to build shared knowledge, not just give people a private testbed.

**Access periods are 2 months by default.** This gives you enough time to install equipment, run experiments, and document results. If your work has a compelling reason to extend and it doesn't prevent other researchers from using the space, we're happy to discuss longer arrangements.

**You assume all risk.** Lucid Computing provides access to the cage on an as-is basis. We are not responsible for damage to your equipment, loss of data, injury, or any other harm that may occur during your use of the facility. You are responsible for your own insurance, safety, and compliance with Equinix's policies. By applying, you agree to sign a liability waiver before accessing the facility.

## Why This Exists

A recurring theme in AI governance and verification research is the gap between theory and practice. Papers propose monitoring architectures, attestation protocols, and verification schemes — but most researchers have never had the opportunity to test these ideas against real infrastructure.

Reading about a data center is not the same as standing in one. The noise, the scale, the physical reality of cable management and power distribution — these things change how you think about what's practical. We believe verification research will be stronger if researchers have access to real environments.

## What It Is (and What It Isn't)

This is important to understand upfront:

### What you get

- **A private cage** in a Tier III+ colocation facility. This is a physically secured enclosure within the Equinix SV4 data center, with controlled access, power delivery, and network connectivity.
- **Rack space and power** for installing your own equipment or verification instrumentation.
- **Standard data center infrastructure** — power distribution (redundant utility feeds, UPS, PDUs), cooling (facility-managed), physical security (mantrap entry, biometric access, 24/7 security), and network cross-connects.
- **Hands-on experience** with the physical environment that AI clusters actually live in: the power chain, the cooling systems, the cabling, the security model.

### What you don't get

**This is not an AI cluster.** There are no GPUs (yet), no NVLink, no InfiniBand fabric, no training jobs to observe. It's critical to be clear about this distinction:

| | Equinix SV4 Cage | AI Training Cluster |
|---|---|---|
| **Facility type** | Colocation data center | Purpose-built AI facility |
| **Cooling** | Facility air cooling (standard colo) | Direct liquid cooling (DLC) required for modern AI racks |
| **Power density** | 5-15 kW per rack (standard) | 40-132 kW per rack (AI workloads) |
| **Compute hardware** | Possibly 1 GPU or DGX (TBD) + whatever you bring | Thousands of GPUs (B200, H100, etc.) |
| **Network** | Standard internet/cross-connect | InfiniBand fat-tree fabric |
| **NVLink domains** | Not present (yet) | The defining feature of modern AI racks |
| **Rack-level power** | Metered at PDU level | Metered + BMC telemetry per GPU |

### What this means for your research

If you're working on verification techniques, the cage is useful for:

- **Facility-level verification:** Testing power monitoring, physical access audit systems, environmental sensing. The power delivery chain (utility → UPS → PDU → rack) is the same architecture as an AI facility, just at lower density.
- **Network monitoring instrumentation:** Installing and testing SmartNICs, TAPs, or other network monitoring equipment on real infrastructure with real latency and real cabling constraints.
- **Physical security protocols:** Developing and testing physical inspection procedures, tamper-evident seals, hardware inventory verification.
- **Sensor deployment:** Testing environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, vibration, acoustic) in a real data center environment with real background noise and thermal conditions.
- **Understanding the environment:** Experiencing the physical constraints that any verification system will need to operate within — noise, access procedures, maintenance windows, shared facility coordination.

It is **not** the right environment for:
- Testing NVLink monitoring approaches (there is no NVLink)
- Observing real training workload signatures (there are no training jobs)
- Testing GPU telemetry integrity at scale (we may have limited GPU hardware — see above — but nothing approaching cluster scale)
- Measuring AI-scale power density effects (power density is 10-20x lower than an AI rack)

Think of it as a realistic testbed for the **facility and physical layers** of verification — the bottom of the stack described in [Chapter 01](/docs/physical-architecture). For the compute and network layers described in [Chapters 02-04](/docs/interconnects), you would need access to an actual AI cluster (for now - please ask Greg Kollmer about how we might be able to realistically simulate this type of traffic in a single rack).

## About Equinix SV4

Equinix SV4 is a production colocation facility in Sunnyvale, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Key specs:

- **Carrier-neutral** facility with access to major cloud on-ramps and peering exchanges
- **Tier III+** design with redundant power and cooling (2N power, N+1 cooling)
- **Physical security:** 24/7 staffed, biometric + badge access, mantrap entry, CCTV throughout
- **Compliance:** SOC 1, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS

This is a facility where real production workloads run. The security model, the operational procedures, and the physical environment are representative of the kind of facility that houses AI clusters — even though the specific hardware inside is different.

## Who Should Apply

This program is designed for:

- **Verification researchers** working on compute governance, AI safety verification, or hardware-rooted trust who need a physical testbed
- **Policy researchers** who write about data center monitoring and want firsthand experience with what these facilities actually look like
- **Graduate students** working on theses related to AI compute verification, infrastructure monitoring, or data center security
- **Independent researchers** with a clear research agenda related to AI infrastructure verification

We're looking for people who have a specific idea of what they want to test or learn. "I want to see a data center" is fine as a secondary goal, but we want the cage to be useful, not just a tourist attraction.

## How to Apply

**[Apply for Lab Access →](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4ORtxtkWyqdf1nUKq9GcZFJiPLhQXSDFwWyusElNOqfrMPA/viewform)**

We'll respond within one week. Access will be coordinated through Equinix's standard visitor and cage access procedures.

## FAQ

**How long do I get access?**
2 months by default. If your experiment needs more time and it doesn't block other researchers from using the space, we're open to extensions — just make the case.

**Is there really no cost?**
No cost for researchers. Lucid Labs covers the cage lease, power, and cross-connect fees. In exchange, you commit to publishing something about your work.

**What counts as "publishing"?**
A peer-reviewed paper, a preprint, a detailed blog post, a technical report, or a substantial contribution to this field guide. The bar is that it needs to be public and contribute to the field's shared knowledge. We're not looking for polished marketing — honest findings, including negative results, are valuable.

**Can I install my own equipment?**
Yes, within the constraints of the cage (available rack units, power budget, and Equinix's acceptable use policies). We'll discuss specifics during onboarding.

**Can I visit without installing equipment?**
Yes. If you're a verification or policy researcher who simply wants to experience a data center environment firsthand, we welcome guided visits. Seeing the physical reality of these facilities is valuable.

**Where is it?**
Equinix SV4, Sunnyvale, California. Close to the Caltrain corridor and major Silicon Valley campuses.

**Do I need to be in the Bay Area?**
Not necessarily, but you need to be able to travel to Sunnyvale for physical access. Remote-only participation isn't possible — the whole point is hands-on access to physical infrastructure.

**What about liability and insurance?**
You assume all risk. Lucid Computing is not liable for damage to your equipment, data loss, injury, or other harm. You'll need to sign a liability waiver before accessing the facility. If your institution requires insurance for off-site research, that's your responsibility to arrange.
