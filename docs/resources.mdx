# Resources

This tutorial is meant to be a starting point. For deeper dives into specific topics, here are resources we've found useful.

## Research & Analysis

- **[Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/)** — Research on AI compute trends, training costs, and scaling. Their compute estimates and trend analyses are widely cited.
- **[SemiAnalysis](https://www.semianalysis.com/)** — Deep technical analysis of semiconductor and AI infrastructure. Paid subscription, but often the most detailed coverage of GPU architectures and data center economics.

## Vendor Documentation

### NVIDIA
- [DGX SuperPOD Reference Architecture](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx-superpod/) — Official documentation for SuperPOD deployments
- [NCCL Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/) — Collective communication library, essential for understanding distributed training
- [InfiniBand Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/) — Network fabric documentation

### AMD
- [Instinct MI300 Series](https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300.html) — AMD's competitor to H100/B200
- [ROCm Documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/) — AMD's GPU compute stack

## Industry Organizations

- **[Open Compute Project (OCP)](https://www.opencompute.org/)** — Open hardware specifications for data center equipment, including AI-optimized designs
